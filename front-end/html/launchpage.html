                    from their content pages. The recommendation engine is designed to increase content engagement, 
                    quality assurance, audience engagement and footfall, directly improving site metrics. X5LEARN's 
                    core product is an AI engine connecting millions of pieces of OER content from different sites, 
                    cultures and in different languages in one interface based on relevance and personal learning needs. 
                    OER publishers use X5LEARN's tools to recirculate their content within other sites, and use it as the 
                    first AI powered open education learning environment.</p>
